########################### word splitting algorithm ###########################
this algorithm is found in src/expansion.c. The version described here is
simplified, as in reality, the algorithm must handle a string that has an
"expansion context", which is an ancillary string of the same length consisting
of either 0's or 1's, where 1 means the byte at the corresponding position in
the real string was the result of a parameter expansion, and 0 means it wasn't.
This is important, because a command like `echo:hello` shouldn't be split on
the colon when IFS=":", but expansion containing a colon should.

# Expample
IFS=<space><colon>
'   :one two    three   :: :  :   four:five :six\0'
result should be: '', 'one', 'two', 'three', '', '', '', 'four', 'five', 'six'

# Algorithm
	- IFS= # whatever
	- IFS_whitespace= # depends on locale
	- str # string to split

	- start = 0
	- i = 0
	- new_words = empty list
	- push = false
	- iterate over str using i until NUL '\0':
		- is str[i] in IFS:
			- yes:
				- is str[i] in IFS_whitespace:
					- yes:
						- should we push (ie. push == true):
							- yes:
								- push word[start:i] (python slice syntax) to new_words
								- updating start to i is optional (better don't)
								- set push to false (consecutive ifs-whitespace should be ignored)
							- no:
								- don't do anything, just skip further
								- do not update start to i
					- no:
						- should we push (ie. push == true):
							- yes:
								- push word[start:i] (python slice syntax) to new_words
								- set start to i (str[start] must be this ifs-non-whitespace-character)
								- set push to false
									- if we now, afterwards, encounter ifs-whitespace, it must be ignored.
									- however, if we then encounter ifs-non-whitespace, we want to push an empty word.
									- this can be conventiently handled in the <no> branch and is dependedent on where
									- str[start] last pointed to (either a ifs-non-whitespace-character or not)
							- no:
								- is str[start] in IFS and (str[start] NOT in IFS_whitespace OR start == 0):
									- yes:
										- push empty word
										- updating start to i is optional
									- no:
										- set start to i (str[start] must be this ifs-non-whitespace-character)
			- no:
				- should we push (ie. push == true):
					- yes:
						- don't do anything, just skip further
					- no:
						- set start to i
						- set push to true
	- we reached NUL '\0'
	- is str[start] NOT in IFS:
		- yes:
			- push word[start:i] (python slice syntax) to new_words
		- no:
			- don't do anything
